In this project, I applied K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. The focus was on determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, visualizing centroids, and evaluating model performance with the Silhouette Plot.

**1. Elbow Method**

The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared distances (inertia) against a range of cluster values.

**2. Visualization Using Euclidean Distance**

Clusters were visualized using Euclidean distance for cluster assignments.

**3. Evaluation Using Silhouette Plot**

The Silhouette Plot was used to evaluate clustering performance.

**Results**

The Elbow Method indicated an optimal cluster number at k=3.
Euclidean distance-based visualization illustrated refined cluster boundaries.
Silhouette Plot confirmed clustering quality with an average score of 0.8

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates effective customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. Future work may include scaling data and testing additional algorithms for comparison.
